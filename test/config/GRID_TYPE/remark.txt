Note in include.ass grid_type is used nested with DOMAIN. 

We should make grid_type a property from domain, i.e. 
we have e.g. domain DKA_CUBIC and DKA_QUADRATIC 
Then the f_JBCV and f_JBBAL can be properties of the domain too. 

# TRUNC specified in Harmonie_domains.pm and CLimate
# and used in both to compute NSMAX  NMSMAX? 
# probably better to make NSMAX and NMSMAX a property of DOMAIN 
# Like already done explicitly for some domains

# Also Makdo determines NSMAX based on grid_type.
