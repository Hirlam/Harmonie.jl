# **** Cycles to run, and their forecast length ****

# The unit of HWRITUPTIMES, FULLFATIMES, ..., SFXFWFTIMES should be:

#   - minutes if TFLAG="min"

# Writeup times of # history,surfex and fullpos files
# Comma separated list, and/or range(s) like:
# t1,t2,t3-t4,t5-t6:step    tb-te == tb-te:1 == tb,tb+1,tb+2,...,te
